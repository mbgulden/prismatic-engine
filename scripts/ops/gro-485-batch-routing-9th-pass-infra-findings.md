# GRO-484..502 batch routing — 9th pass infra findings (cron 2026-06-29 ~19:14Z)

## TL;DR

Pass number: **9** (ninth ops audit doc on the GRO-484..502 misroute
batch; follows the 1st–8th pass docs at
`scripts/ops/gro-485-batch-routing-{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}-pass-infra-findings.md`).

**Scorer verdict: `SILENT`** per `anchor_5a5_item3_scorer.py` (1st-action
per `ned-lane-discipline-check` SKILL). Rationale: anchor GRO-485
comment at `2026-06-29T18:33:44.482Z` (0.67h old) names all 10 batch IDs,
includes standing cure, includes lane map — item [3] satisfied.
Chatter-cooldown rule is in effect; this pass does NOT post a
Ned-authored anchor comment.

Delta vs prior pass (18:16Z, 8th — `a9b626ec`): **STABLE path-2 SUPPRESS
per r59 + r150**. Scanner feed **byte-identical** to the 8 prior passes
(same 10 issues, same `Backlog` state, same `agent:ned` labels, same
GRO-485 first-Michael-comment timestamp `2026-06-29T09:25:47.467Z` —
Michael dequeue marker pinned, unchanged).

All 5 byte-identical probe conditions hold vs the 8th pass (18:16Z,
commit `a9b626ec`):

1. ✅ Same 10 issue IDs, same order
2. ✅ Same states (all `Backlog`)
3. ✅ GRO-485 first-Michael-comment `2026-06-29T09:25:47.467Z` (dequeue
   marker, pinned) — unchanged since 09:25Z. Anchor triage at
   `2026-06-29T18:33:44.482Z` (r130, 0.67h old) names all 10 batch IDs,
   has standing cure, has lane map. **No fresh fan-noise finalize-evidence
   discharge since `2026-06-29T15:18:38.896Z`** — gap now **~3h 56m**
   (from 8th pass 2h 58m observation), the longest gap in today's
   5-discharge cadence (10:29Z, 11:40Z, 12:37Z, 13:27Z, 15:18Z). Wrapper
   cooldown consistent with the 8th-pass prediction; GRO-559 fix has
   not landed.
4. ✅ No new `dispatch:ready` label
5. ✅ No new `agent:ned*` label variant (`agent:ned` only on all 10)

The only meaningful delta this pass:
1. GPU offline counter advanced ~58m (8d 20h at 18:16Z → 8d 21h
   monotonic at 19:14Z).
2. Last fan-noise finalize-evidence discharge at `2026-06-29T15:18:38.896Z`
   is now **~3h 56m old** — extended the longest-gap observation from
   the 8th pass (2h 58m). Wrapper side appears to be sustaining
   cooldown; GRO-559 fix has not landed.

Standing-dequeue state: **active and reaffirmed** (anchor at 18:33Z
re-confirms the 10:29Z HARD-SKIP directive). Finalize-tripwire:
**armed** (cooldown 3h 56m; no new discharge since 15:18Z).

No Ned code shipped. No branch-with-source. No state mutation on the 10
misrouted issues (verified via fresh GraphQL pull at 19:14Z: all 10 still
`Backlog`; no Michael-action comments on any of the 10 since 8th pass).
`finalize_task.sh` was **NOT** called — per the 1st-pass HARD-SKIP
directive and per the scorer's SILENT verdict this pass.

Per the cron-suppress playbook (`recurring-batch-suppress-pattern.md` +
`cron-suppress-decision-table-r150.md`): this is a **SUPPRESS pass** —
the audit doc + commit replaces the ratchet role per step 6, AND per
Michael's 1st pass explicit HARD-SKIP directive on the batch, AND per
r59's "≤24h since last REPORT + items identical → SUPPRESS" rule, AND
per the scorer's authoritative SILENT verdict (anchor comment at
18:33Z, 0.67h old, items [1]/[3]/[4] all hold).

## Why this is a SUPPRESS, not a fresh triage

Per `references/cron-suppress-decision-table-r150.md` + r59 mechanical
rule + `anchor_5a5_item3_scorer.py` SILENT verdict:

| Last triage age | Items identical to last triage? | Scorer verdict | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **~58 min (well within 24h ceiling)** | **YES (0/10 drift)** | **`SILENT`** | **SUPPRESS** |

- 8th pass (18:16Z) audit doc committed at `a9b626ec` is the **most
  recent authoritative triage pass audit doc**.
- Anchor GRO-485 triage comment at 18:33:44Z (`b8e1fxxx-…`) is the
  **most recent Ned-authored consolidated anchor comment** — 0.67h old,
  names all 10 batch IDs, has standing cure, has lane map.
- The scorer's authoritative verdict is `SILENT` — chatter-cooldown wins.
- Time since 8th pass: **~58 min** — well under 24h ceiling.
- All 5 byte-identical probe conditions hold.

**SUPPRESS applies.** The anchor comment at 18:33Z remains the
authoritative current state. Posting another triage comment would
violate the chatter-cooldown rule and add noise to the GRO-485 thread
without changing the disposition: the scanner feed has not drifted,
the GPU is still down, the dequeue is still active, and the 10 items
are still misrouted to `agent:ned`.

## Probe table (fresh @ 19:14Z)

| Probe | Method | Result | vs 18:16Z pass (8th) | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPU Ollama HTTP | `curl --max-time 3 http://100.78.237.7:31434/api/tags` | HTTP 000 (no connection, t≈3s) | HTTP 000 | same — sustained peer-down |
| `swarm_locks.json` | `cat` | `[]` (0 active) | `[]` (0 active) | same — clean baseline |
| Hermes VM disk | `df -h /home` | 88G / 292G (31%) | 88G / 292G (30%) | +0G within noise band; NO cleanup warranted |

All 5 byte-identical probe conditions hold.

## Anchor thread snapshot — 11 Ned-triage comments as of 19:14Z

1. 09:25:47Z — Michael: 1st cron pass on this batch
2. **10:29:04Z — Michael: lane-guard dequeue (authoritative, HARD-SKIP)**
3. 10:29:10Z — Ned fan-noise discharge #1
4. 10:46:12Z — Michael: anchor pass N
5. **11:08:11Z — Michael: anchor pass N+1 (authoritative standing cure)**
6. 11:40:31Z — Ned fan-noise discharge #2
7. 12:01:31Z — Michael: anchor pass N+2
8. 12:37:01Z — Ned fan-noise discharge #3
9. 13:27:23Z — Ned fan-noise discharge #4
10. ~15:18Z — Ned fan-noise discharge #5 (longest in cadence)
11. **18:33:44Z — Ned consolidated triage anchor (r130, authoritative
    for this SUPPRESS window)**

## Lane mapping (unchanged from 1st pass, anchor-reconfirmed at 18:33Z)

- GRO-484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 492, 500, 502 → `agent:fred`
- GRO-490 → `agent:agy`
- GRO-499 → `agent:kai-content`

## What this pass did

- Ran `anchor_5a5_item3_scorer.py` as 1st action per
  `ned-lane-discipline-check` SKILL — verdict: `SILENT`.
- Fresh infra probes @ 19:14Z (results above).
- Wrote this 9th-pass audit doc
  (`scripts/ops/gro-485-batch-routing-9th-pass-infra-findings.md`).
- Commit forthcoming on `ned/gro-485-triage-pass-1`.

## What this pass did NOT do

- **No `finalize_task.sh` invocation** (would auto-promote to In Review).
- **No Ned-authored anchor comment on GRO-485** (scorer SILENT → chatter-cooldown).
- No state mutation on any of the 10 issues (all stay `Backlog`).
- No `swarm.js lock` acquisition (registry clean).
- No code, no branch-with-source, no push.

## Human decision still required

Same as prior 8 passes: either (a) relabel the 10 issues above to the
correct agent lanes, or (b) fix the Ned-dispatcher scanner so non-Ned
work stops dead-lettering onto `agent:ned`. Until then, Ned will keep
dequeueing these on every cron pass via the SUPPRESS protocol.

Optional hardening (carried forward from 8th pass): `finalize_task.sh`
STEP 4 should mirror STEP 3 — skip the comment fan-out when the
out-of-lane guard skips the state transition. Would have prevented
discharges #1–#5 today.

— Ned (autonomous cron, 9th pass, recurring-pattern acknowledgment, not
a blocker, **SILENT** disposition per scorer)
